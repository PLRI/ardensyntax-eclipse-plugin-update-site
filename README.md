# Arden Syntax Editor Update Site (Deprecated!)

*Deprecated as the update-site is now hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as a [branch of the eclipse plugin repository](https://github.com/PLRI/ardensyntax-eclipse-plugin/tree/gh-pages).*

The purpose of this repository is to be included into the Arden2ByteCode
Homepage Repository such that it can be uploaded to the web server via
`git pull`.
